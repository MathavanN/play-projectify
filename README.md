# Play Projectify – Microservices with .NET Aspire


This repository contains my hands-on exploration of **Microservice Architecture using .NET Aspire**. The goal of this project is to understand how modern distributed systems are designed, orchestrated, and observed using Microsoft’s **cloud-native** stack.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- .NET 10
- .NET Aspire
- ASP.NET Core Web API
- Blazor
- SQLite

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The solution follows a microservices-based architecture:

- Independent .NET Core Web APIs
- Orchestration using .NET Aspire 13
- Service-to-service communication
- Blazor frontend for UI
- SQLite for lightweight data persistence
- Centralized configuration and service discovery via Aspire

This project focuses on building loosely coupled, scalable, and maintainable services.

## 🎯 What I’m Learning

- Microservice architecture fundamentals
- Distributed system design
- Service orchestration with Aspire
- API communication between services
- Managing configuration in distributed apps
- Building full-stack apps with Blazor + APIs
- Working with lightweight relational databases (SQLite)

*Happy coding!* 🚀
